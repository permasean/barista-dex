# Kani Formal Verification Status

**Date**: 2025-10-24 (Updated with explicit property proofs)
**Status**: 26 of 26 proofs passing (100% ✅)
**Total Verification Time**: <35 seconds

---

## Executive Summary

After optimizing generator bounds and fixing a margin check bug, **all 26 proofs** now complete in **0.02s - 3.6s each**, down from hours/never. This makes Kani verification practical for regular use.

**New**: Added 6 explicit property proofs for documentation and auditing (I5+, I5++, I5+++, I7+, I8+, I9+)

### Key Achievement

**~100,000x speedup** on previously stuck proofs by reducing:
- Value bounds: 1000 → 100
- Users: 1-2 → 1
- Price range: narrowed

## Bug Found and Fixed ✅

### L13: withdraw_pnl Self-Liquidation Bug

**Status**: FIXED
**Discovery**: Kani L13 proof found a counterexample where users could withdraw themselves into liquidation
**Root Cause**: `withdraw_pnl` didn't check if withdrawal would violate maintenance margin requirements

**The Bug**:
```rust
// Before (transitions.rs:167):
user.pnl_ledger = sub_i128(user.pnl_ledger, withdraw_i128);  // No margin check!
```

**Example Counterexample**:
```
Initial: principal=5, pnl=6, position=100, margin_req=10%
collateral = 5 + 6 = 11 >= 10 ✓ NOT liquidatable

Withdraw 2 from PnL:
collateral = 5 + 4 = 9 < 10 ✗ LIQUIDATABLE!
```

**The Fix**:
Added margin health check using scaled arithmetic (consistent with `is_liquidatable`):
```rust
// Calculate safe withdraw limit: (collateral * 1M - position * margin_bps) / 1M
let collateral_scaled = mul_u128(current_collateral, 1_000_000);
let required_margin_scaled = mul_u128(position_size, maintenance_margin_bps as u128);
let margin_limited_withdraw = div_u128(sub_u128(collateral_scaled, required_margin_scaled), 1_000_000);

// Take minimum of warmup cap and margin safety limit
let actual_withdraw = min_u128(min_u128(amount, max_withdrawable), margin_limited_withdraw);
```

**Impact**: Critical security fix - prevents users from self-liquidating via PnL withdrawal
**Verification**: L13 now passes in 1.86s ✅

## Performance Comparison

### Before Bound Reduction

| Proof | Time | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| deposit_increases_principal_and_vault | **11+ hours** | Never completed |
| l2_noop_when_none_liquidatable | **10+ hours** | Never completed |
| l3_liquidatable_count_never_increases | **3+ min** | Timeout |

### After Bound Reduction

| Proof | Time | Speedup |
|-------|------|---------|
| deposit_increases_principal_and_vault | **0.4s** | ~100,000x |
| l2_noop_when_none_liquidatable | **1.7s** | ~21,000x |
| l3_liquidatable_count_never_increases | **1.2s** | ~150x |

---

## Bound Configuration

Current generator bounds (in `proofs/kani/src/generators.rs`):

```rust
const MAX_VAL: u128 = 100;        // Down from 1000
const MAX_PNL: i128 = 100;        // Down from 1000

// State bounds:
- Users: 1 only (was 1-2)
- Vault: up to 3x MAX_VAL (was 5x)
- Reserved PnL: up to MAX_VAL/2 (was MAX_VAL)
- Warmup slots: 0-20 (was 0-100)
- Warmup slope: 1-20 (was 1-100)
- Prices: 0.5-1.5 (was 0.1-2.0)
- Withdraw cap: 100 (was 1000)
- Margin BPS: 50k-100k (was 30k-100k)
```

### Trade-offs

✅ **Strengths**:
- Verification completes in seconds (practical for CI/CD)
- Catches overflow/underflow bugs
- Tests core invariant logic
- Found real issue (L13)

⚠️ **Limitations**:
- Reduced numeric range (0-100 vs 0-1000)
- Single user only (no multi-user interactions)
- Smaller price volatility
- Some edge cases may be missed
