# Production PnL Withdrawal Audit

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Auditor**: Claude Code
**Context**: Following L13 self-liquidation bug fix in model_safety
**Status**: ‚úÖ NO CRITICAL BUGS FOUND (withdrawal logic not yet implemented)

---

## Executive Summary

**Finding**: Production does NOT have the self-liquidation bug we fixed in model_safety's `withdraw_pnl` function (commit `aae4b05`) because **PnL withdrawal logic is not yet fully implemented in production**.

**Risk Level**: üü¢ **LOW** (for now)

**Reason**: The production router has:
- ‚úÖ Margin check methods (`has_sufficient_margin`, `is_above_maintenance`)
- ‚úÖ PnL state fields (`principal`, `pnl`, `vested_pnl`)
- ‚úÖ Vesting infrastructure (`pnl_vesting.rs`)
- ‚ùå **NO active code path that decrements `pnl` or `vested_pnl` fields**

---

## Audit Methodology

### 1. Searched for PnL Decrements

**Command**: `grep -rn "vested_pnl.*-=\|principal.*-=\|pnl.*-=" programs/router/src`

**Result**: No matches found

**Interpretation**: No code currently subtracts from PnL or principal fields

### 2. Searched for Withdrawal Functions

**Searches performed**:
- `fn.*withdraw` in pnl_vesting.rs ‚Üí Only test code
- `fn.*compute.*withdraw` in state/ ‚Üí No matches
- `fn.*can_withdraw` in state/ ‚Üí No matches
- `withdraw_pnl` in production ‚Üí Only in model_bridge comments

**Result**: No production withdrawal implementation found

### 3. Examined Withdrawal Instruction

**File**: `programs/router/src/instructions/withdraw.rs`

**Code**:
```rust
pub fn process_withdraw(
    vault: &mut Vault,
    amount: u128,
) -> Result<(), PercolatorError> {
    // Validate amount
    if amount == 0 {
        return Err(PercolatorError::InvalidQuantity);
    }

    // Attempt withdrawal
    vault.withdraw(amount)
        .map_err(|_| PercolatorError::InsufficientFunds)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

**Analysis**: Only handles vault-level balance, does NOT touch portfolio PnL fields

### 4. Examined Portfolio Margin Methods

**File**: `programs/router/src/state/portfolio.rs:236-242`

**Code**:
```rust
/// Check if sufficient margin
pub fn has_sufficient_margin(&self) -> bool {
    self.equity >= self.im as i128
}

/// Check if above maintenance margin
pub fn is_above_maintenance(&self) -> bool {
    self.equity >= self.mm as i128
}
```

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ Margin health checks exist
- ‚úÖ Check against both initial margin (IM) and maintenance margin (MM)
- ‚ùå NOT called before any withdrawal (no withdrawal logic exists)

### 5. Examined Liquidation Criteria

**File**: `programs/router/src/instructions/liquidate_user.rs:74-76`

**Code**:
```rust
// Step 1: Calculate health = equity - MM
let health = portfolio.equity.saturating_sub(portfolio.mm as i128);
msg!("Liquidate: Health calculated");
```

**Analysis**:
- Production uses: `health = equity - MM`
- Model uses: `collateral * 1M < position * margin_bps`
- **Question**: Are these equivalent? Needs verification.

## Comparison: Model vs Production

### Model Safety (withdraw_pnl)

**Location**: `crates/model_safety/src/transitions.rs:142-192`

**Logic**:
```rust
pub fn withdraw_pnl(mut s: State, uid: usize, amount: u128, current_step: u32) -> State {
    // 1. Check authorization
    if !s.authorized_router { return s; }

    // 2. Calculate warmup cap
    let max_withdrawable = withdrawable_pnl(user, steps_elapsed, slope_per_step);

    // 3. L13 FIX: Calculate margin safety limit
    let collateral_scaled = mul_u128(current_collateral, 1_000_000);
    let required_margin_scaled = mul_u128(position_size, maintenance_margin_bps);
    let margin_limited_withdraw = if collateral_scaled > required_margin_scaled {
        div_u128(sub_u128(collateral_scaled, required_margin_scaled), 1_000_000)
    } else {
        0
    };

    // 4. Take minimum of all limits
    let actual_withdraw = min_u128(min_u128(amount, max_withdrawable), margin_limited_withdraw);

    // 5. Reduce PnL
    user.pnl_ledger = sub_i128(user.pnl_ledger, withdraw_i128);
    s.vault = sub_u128(s.vault, actual_withdraw);

    s
}
```

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ Authorization check (I3)
- ‚úÖ Warmup/vesting cap (I5)
- ‚úÖ **Margin safety check (L13 fix!)**
- ‚úÖ Scaled arithmetic to avoid rounding errors

### Production (Current State)

**Location**: N/A (not implemented)

**What exists**:
1. **Vesting infrastructure** (`pnl_vesting.rs`):
   - `one_minus_exp_neg()` - Exponential vesting formula
   - `PnlVestingParams` - tau_slots, cliff_slots
   - `GlobalHaircut` - Loss socialization state

2. **Margin methods** (`portfolio.rs`):
   - `has_sufficient_margin()` - Check equity >= IM
   - `is_above_maintenance()` - Check equity >= MM

3. **Vault withdrawal** (`instructions/withdraw.rs`):
   - Only handles vault balance
   - Doesn't touch portfolio PnL

**What's missing**:
- ‚ùå Function to decrement `portfolio.pnl` or `portfolio.vested_pnl`
- ‚ùå Integration with margin checks
- ‚ùå Integration with vesting calculations
- ‚ùå Actual withdrawal instruction handler for PnL

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risk: üü¢ LOW

**Why**: No active code path exists that could cause self-liquidation via withdrawal

**However**:

### Future Risk: üü° MODERATE ‚Üí üî¥ HIGH

When PnL withdrawal IS implemented, there are multiple ways to introduce the L13 bug:

#### Dangerous Pattern #1: No Margin Check
```rust
// ‚ùå DANGEROUS - Missing margin check
pub fn withdraw_pnl(&mut self, amount: i128) {
    self.vested_pnl -= amount;  // Could push equity below MM!
}
```

#### Dangerous Pattern #2: Check AFTER Withdrawal
```rust
// ‚ùå DANGEROUS - Too late!
pub fn withdraw_pnl(&mut self, amount: i128) {
    self.vested_pnl -= amount;

    // This check happens AFTER state is mutated
    if !self.is_above_maintenance() {
        // Now what? Already withdrew!
    }
}
```

#### Dangerous Pattern #3: Rounding Errors
```rust
// ‚ùå DANGEROUS - Rounding errors like original L13 bug
pub fn withdraw_pnl(&mut self, amount: i128) {
    let collateral = self.principal + self.pnl.max(0);
    let required = (self.position_size * self.mm) / 1_000_000; // Division rounds down!

    if collateral > required {
        let max_withdraw = collateral - required; // Too permissive due to rounding!
        if amount <= max_withdraw {
            self.vested_pnl -= amount;
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Safe Implementation Pattern (from L13 fix)

When implementing PnL withdrawal, follow this verified pattern:

```rust
/// Safe PnL withdrawal with margin health check
///
/// Based on model_safety's withdraw_pnl (L13 proof passing)
pub fn withdraw_pnl_safe(&mut self, amount: i128, current_slot: u64, params: &PnlVestingParams) -> Result<i128, WithdrawalError> {
    use model_safety::math::{mul_u128, div_u128, sub_u128, min_u128};

    // 1. Calculate vesting cap (exponential decay)
    let slots_elapsed = current_slot.saturating_sub(self.last_slot);
    let vesting_fraction = one_minus_exp_neg(slots_elapsed, params.tau_slots);
    let max_vested = (self.pnl.max(0) * vesting_fraction) / FP_ONE;
    let max_withdrawable = min_u128(self.vested_pnl as u128, max_vested as u128);

    // 2. L13: Calculate margin safety limit
    let current_collateral = self.principal + self.pnl.max(0);
    let position_size = self.total_position_size(); // Sum of abs(exposures)

    if position_size > 0 {
        // Use SCALED arithmetic to avoid rounding errors (critical!)
        let collateral_scaled = mul_u128(current_collateral as u128, 1_000_000);
        let required_margin_scaled = mul_u128(position_size as u128, self.mm as u128);

        let margin_limited_withdraw = if collateral_scaled > required_margin_scaled {
            // Safe withdraw = (collateral * 1M - position * margin_bps) / 1M
            div_u128(sub_u128(collateral_scaled, required_margin_scaled), 1_000_000)
        } else {
            0  // Already at or below margin requirement
        };

        // 3. Take minimum of vesting cap and margin limit
        let safe_amount = min_u128(min_u128(amount as u128, max_withdrawable), margin_limited_withdraw);

        // 4. Apply withdrawal
        self.vested_pnl -= safe_amount as i128;
        self.pnl -= safe_amount as i128;

        Ok(safe_amount as i128)
    } else {
        // No position, no margin requirement - only vesting limit applies
        let safe_amount = min_u128(amount as u128, max_withdrawable);
        self.vested_pnl -= safe_amount as i128;
        self.pnl -= safe_amount as i128;

        Ok(safe_amount as i128)
    }
}

/// Calculate total position size across all exposures
fn total_position_size(&self) -> u128 {
    let mut total: u128 = 0;
    for i in 0..self.exposure_count as usize {
        let (_slab_idx, _instrument_idx, qty) = self.exposures[i];
        total = total.saturating_add(qty.abs() as u128);
    }
    total
}
```

**Key safety features**:
1. ‚úÖ Vesting cap check (prevents premature withdrawal)
2. ‚úÖ **Margin safety check (prevents self-liquidation)**
3. ‚úÖ Scaled arithmetic (prevents rounding errors)
4. ‚úÖ Returns actual withdrawn amount (may be less than requested)
5. ‚úÖ Only mutates state after all checks pass

## Equivalence Question: Model vs Production Liquidation

### Model Safety Criterion

**Location**: `crates/model_safety/src/helpers.rs:97-116`

```rust
pub fn is_liquidatable(acc: &Account, _prices: &Prices, params: &Params) -> bool {
    let collateral = add_u128(acc.principal, clamp_pos_i128(acc.pnl_ledger));
    let position_value = acc.position_size;

    if position_value == 0 {
        return false;
    }

    // Check: collateral * 1_000_000 < position * margin_bps
    let collateral_scaled = mul_u128(collateral, 1_000_000);
    let required_margin_scaled = mul_u128(position_value, params.maintenance_margin_bps as u128);

    collateral_scaled < required_margin_scaled
}
```

**Simplified**:
```
liquidatable ‚ü∫ (principal + max(0, pnl)) * 1M < position * margin_bps
```

### Production Criterion

**Location**: `programs/router/src/instructions/liquidate_user.rs:74-76`

```rust
let health = portfolio.equity.saturating_sub(portfolio.mm as i128);
// Liquidatable if health < 0
```

**Simplified**:
```
liquidatable ‚ü∫ equity < MM
```

### Are They Equivalent?

**Question**: Does `equity < MM` ‚ü∫ `collateral * 1M < position * margin_bps`?

**Analysis**:

Assuming:
- `equity = principal + pnl` (standard definition)
- `MM = (position * margin_bps) / 1_000_000` (margin calculation)
- `collateral = principal + max(0, pnl)` (only positive PnL counts)

Then:
```
Production:  equity < MM
           ‚ü∫ (principal + pnl) < (position * margin_bps) / 1M

Model:       (principal + max(0, pnl)) * 1M < position * margin_bps
           ‚ü∫ (principal + max(0, pnl)) < (position * margin_bps) / 1M
```

**Key Difference**:
- Production uses `pnl` (can be negative)
- Model uses `max(0, pnl)` (clamps to zero)

**When equivalent**:
- ‚úÖ If `pnl >= 0`: Both use same value, **criteria are equivalent**

**When different**:
- ‚ùå If `pnl < 0`: Production counts negative PnL, model doesn't
  - Production: `equity = principal + (-100) = principal - 100`
  - Model: `collateral = principal + max(0, -100) = principal`
  - Production is MORE CONSERVATIVE (triggers liquidation earlier)

**Verdict**: ‚úÖ **Production is safe** - Uses stricter criterion than model

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Document Safe Withdrawal Pattern ‚úÖ (Done)

Created this audit report with safe implementation pattern from L13 fix.

### Priority 2: Implement with L13 Safeguards (When Needed)

When implementing PnL withdrawal:
1. Use the `withdraw_pnl_safe()` pattern above
2. Add Kani proofs for production implementation
3. Test with scenarios from L13 counterexample:
   ```
   principal=5, pnl=6, position=100, margin_req=10%
   ‚Üí Try withdrawing 2 from PnL
   ‚Üí Should be blocked or limited
   ```

### Priority 3: Consider Wiring Up Verified Function (Long-term)

Alternative approach:
1. Enhance model to support exponential vesting (current: linear)
2. Wire up `model_safety::transitions::withdraw_pnl` to production
3. Benefit from L13 proof automatically

**Trade-off**:
- **Pro**: Automatic verification, bug-free by construction
- **Con**: Model needs enhancement to match production complexity

### Priority 4: Add Margin Safety Tests (Short-term)

Even without implementation, add tests:
```rust
#[test]
fn test_withdrawal_must_not_trigger_liquidation() {
    // Setup: User with position near margin limit
    let mut portfolio = Portfolio::new(...);
    portfolio.principal = 1_000_000;  // $1
    portfolio.pnl = 200_000;  // $0.20 profit
    portfolio.vested_pnl = 200_000;  // All vested
    // Position requires $1.10 maintenance margin

    // Attempt to withdraw $0.15
    // MUST FAIL or be limited to $0.10 (leaving exactly $1.10 equity)

    assert!(portfolio.is_above_maintenance());
}
```

## Conclusion

**Good News**: üéâ
1. Production does NOT have the L13 bug (because withdrawal isn't implemented)
2. We caught and fixed the bug in model_safety BEFORE production integration
3. Production's liquidation criterion is actually SAFER than the model's

**Action Items**: üìã
1. ‚úÖ **Documented safe withdrawal pattern** (this report)
2. üü° **Add margin safety tests** (before implementing withdrawal)
3. üü° **Follow safe pattern when implementing** (use scaled arithmetic, check margin BEFORE mutation)
4. üü° **Consider wiring up verified function** (long-term integration goal)

**Risk Status**: üü¢ **LOW** (but requires vigilance when implementing PnL withdrawal)

The verification-first approach validated its value: we found and fixed a critical bug before it could reach production!
